Welcome to my first project from The Odin Project.

This is not exactly a new process for me since, at the time of this project, I am employed as a SDE Apprentice in a Front-end Engineer position.

Please enjoy this recipy page that will demonstrate skills in basic HTML incliding:
    1) Headings,
    2) Links,
    3) Images,
    4) Lists

Feedback is always welcome!

Cheers,
Seth.
